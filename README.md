Hello and welcome, you are just in time for the arrival of the new champion!! <br>

than all previous, a challenger brave enough to tackle maze building head on! <br><br>

A bit similar to a QR code but not a QR code, a maze solver! <br><br>

>_You try to solve the puzzle in your head, it's pretty easy_

<br>

You can set the size of the grid you want via the macros defined, <br>
to run: <br> 
1. ```make``` (make sure you have make installed) <br>
2. ```./targets/main``` <br><br>
Dependecies: SDL2, mingw
